# Claude Code TMUX Team

**Run 10 Claude Code agents in parallel. One terminal.**

Orchestrate a fleet of AI coding agents with a Manager that plans, Workers that execute,<br>and a Watchdog that keeps everything running — all inside tmux.

## The Problem

You have 30 files to refactor. One Claude Code instance. You wait for each file, one by one. It takes forever.

## The Solution

TMUX Claude Team launches **10 Claude Code instances in parallel**, coordinated by a Manager agent that breaks your task into subtasks, dispatches them to idle workers, and monitors progress — all in a single tmux session.

You talk to the Manager. The Manager runs the team. You ship 10x faster.

---

## Quick Start

**One command — no clone needed:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frikk-gyldendal/claude-code-tmux-team/main/web-install.sh | bash
```

**Or clone and install locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frikk-gyldendal/claude-code-tmux-team.git
cd claude-code-tmux-team && ./install.sh
```

**Then reload your shell and launch:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or open a new terminal
claude-team       # default 6x2 grid (10 workers)
```

That's it. The Manager boots up, workers come online, and you're asked what to work on.

```bash
claude-team 4x3      # custom grid layout
claude-team 3x2      # smaller team (4 workers)
claude-team --help   # all options
```

## How It Works

<table>
<tr>
<td width="40" align="center"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>You tell the Manager what to do — <em>"Refactor all components to use the new design tokens"</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>2</strong></td>
<td>The Manager analyzes the task and breaks it into independent, parallelizable subtasks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>3</strong></td>
<td>Each subtask is dispatched to an idle worker with a self-contained prompt</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>4</strong></td>
<td>The Watchdog monitors workers and auto-accepts permission prompts to keep them unblocked</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><strong>5</strong></td>
<td>The Manager tracks progress and reports back when everything is done</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Features

- **Parallel execution** — 10 workers running simultaneously, not sequentially
- **Smart orchestration** — Manager plans, delegates, and monitors without writing code itself
- **Auto-unblocking** — Watchdog handles `y/n` prompts, permission dialogs, and confirmations
- **Flexible grid** — Configure `COLSxROWS` to match your screen and workload
- **Message bus** — Workers, Manager, and Watchdog communicate through a lightweight file-based system
- **Slash commands** — Built-in `/tmux-dispatch`, `/tmux-monitor`, `/tmux-team` and more
- **Zero config** — Clone, install, launch. Works with any project.
- **Restartable** — Restart workers without killing the Manager with `/tmux-restart-workers`

## Architecture

| Role | Pane | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Manager** | `0.0` | Plans tasks, delegates to workers, monitors progress. Never writes code. |
| **Watchdog** | `0.{cols}` | Monitors all worker panes. Auto-accepts prompts and confirmations. |
| **Workers** | All others | Standard Claude Code instances that do the actual implementation work. |

### Communication

| Channel | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Task dispatch | `tmux send-keys` / `tmux paste-buffer` |
| Progress monitoring | `tmux capture-pane` |
| Inter-pane messages | `/tmp/claude-team/messages/` |
| Broadcasts | `/tmp/claude-team/broadcasts/` |
| Status tracking | `/tmp/claude-team/status/` |

---

## Grid Configurations

The argument to `claude-team` is a `COLSxROWS` specification. Two panes are always reserved (Manager + Watchdog):

| Grid | Panes | Workers | Best for |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `6x2` | 12 | 10 | **Default** — large refactors, codebase sweeps |
| `4x3` | 12 | 10 | Taller panes — better for reading output |
| `4x2` | 8 | 6 | Medium tasks, smaller screens |
| `3x2` | 6 | 4 | Quick parallel tasks |
| `8x1` | 8 | 6 | Single row — maximizes pane height |

<summary><strong>Slash Commands Reference</strong></summary>

Once installed, these commands are available in any Claude Code instance:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tmux-dispatch` | Dispatch tasks to workers (primary send mechanism) |
| `/tmux-delegate` | Delegate a task to a specific pane |
| `/tmux-monitor` | Check status of all workers |
| `/tmux-team` | View full team overview with statuses |
| `/tmux-send` | Send a message to another pane |
| `/tmux-broadcast` | Broadcast a message to all panes |
| `/tmux-inbox` | Check incoming messages |
| `/tmux-status` | Set or view pane statuses |
| `/tmux-restart-workers` | Restart all workers (keeps Manager alive) |

## Tips

**Aliases** — Add these to your shell config for quick access:

```bash
alias ct="claude-team"
alias ct4="claude-team 4x2"
alias cts="claude-team 3x2"   # small team
```

**Project commands** — Copy the commands into your project for project-scoped access:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/claude-code-tmux-team/commands/ .claude/commands/
```

---

## Requirements

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) (any recent version)
- macOS or Linux
- A terminal with a large window (the grid needs room)
